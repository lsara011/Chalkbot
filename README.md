ChalkBot is a single-repo Miami APA rules assistant that pairs a React (Vite + TypeScript) frontend with an ASP.NET Core 8 Web API to query an OpenAI Assistant (Assistants v2) grounded in uploaded APA bylaws and manuals; the frontend submits prompts to the API and renders safe Markdown responses, while the backend creates/continues threads, runs the assistant, aggregates complete outputs, and resolves clean, human-readable document titles for citations; environment variables (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ASSISTANT_ID`, and `VITE_API_BASE`) are used for configuration, secrets are never committed, and the repository primarily serves as a storage place for source and documentation with optional local development by running the API and web app concurrently.
